# Discussion Assignment: Shortcuts
Pick an application you use a lot (examples: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Microsoft Word, Adobe Premiere, VS Code, etc.). Your goal is to find and test a keyboard shortcut that helps you work faster.

## Steps
- Choose an application you use frequently.
- Find a list of keyboard shortcuts for that application.
    - Examples of what a shortcut looks like: Ctrl + C (copy), Ctrl + V (paste), Ctrl + Z (undo).
- From that list, choose one shortcut that:
    - You have never used before
    - You think would be useful
    - No one else has already posted for that same application
- Give it a test run (actually try it in the application).
## Your post
- Application Name:
    - (What program did you try the shortcut in?)
- Keyboard Shortcut Discovered:
    - (Exactly which keys do you press? Example: Ctrl + Shift + N)
- What This Shortcut Does:
    - (Briefly explain the function or action this shortcut performs.)
- Will you keep using it? Why or why not?
    - (After testing it out, do you think this shortcut will become part of your routine? Explain your reasoning.)
## Replies / reactions
Replies are semi-optional, but please put at least 2 thumbs up (or similar) under shortcuts you think are worthwhile so classmates can quickly find the ones that matter.
